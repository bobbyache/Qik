Support for Antlr4 exists for Visual Studio 2012 (and presumably 2010, although I no longer have this installed so I can’t test it), but not, it seems, for Visual Studio 2013. To get the files you need, visit the Antlr download page and get the ‘ANTLR 4 C#.dll’ zip file. Next, click on the ‘C# releases’ link, and from the page that loads, scroll down to ‘Visual Studio 2010 Extensions’ and click on the ‘ANTLR Language Support’ link, then ‘Download’ the Visual Studio plugin from that page, then install it, making sure you’ve selected the correct version of Visual Studio in the dialog.
